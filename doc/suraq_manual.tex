\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Welcome to \suraq, the \emph{\textbful{S}ynthesizer using
\textbful{U}ninterpreted Functions, A\textbful{r}rays \textbful{a}nd
E\textbful{q}uality}.\footnote{Any similarity to the name of the
ancient Vulcan logician ``Surak'' \cite{Memory_Alpha_Surak} is
completely coincidental. ;-)} \suraq is a tool for
correct-by-construction controller synthesis. It takes a (logical)
correctness criterion as input, where control signals are
existentially quantified. It then constructs functions for these
control signals so that the specification is fulfilled. The
correctness criterion is expressed as a formula in the logic of
arrays, uninterpreted functions, and equality, with limited
quantification. The theory behind the synthesis approach is presented
in \cite{Hoffer11}.
